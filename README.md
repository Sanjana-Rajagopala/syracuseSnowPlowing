# Syracuse Snow Plowing Data Hackathon

Every year, the City of Syracuse is covered with feet of snow and is often the snowiest place in the country. 

With all of that snow, plows need to clear the more than 400 miles of roads to ensure safe transportation for the community. For the first time, the City of Syracuse  released data from GPS trackers on its snowplows.

For this hackathon, I created data visualizations, found interesting insights to help City staff determine what they should look for from this data when it snows. These intuitive Tableau dashboards helped in interpretation of snow plowing and optimization of the routes for snow trucks in the city of Syracuse.


Some of the insights - 
1. The busiest hours for snow plowing - Early Mornings : Between 3 AM to & 7 AM.
2. Majority of the activity by the Snow Trucks - Spreader On with Plow Down.

A glimpse of the visualizations are uploaded as images. For further information, refer and download the SnowPlow.twb workbook file.
